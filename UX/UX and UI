interiors and exterior of the restaurnant, the design, menu cards, the dress code of the employees, how the flood served looks etc.
The UX refers to the sum of each of the experience that each of the customers goes through starting from the table allocation, choice
of food offered, customer service that is offered, the food quality etc.

Basically, UI refers to the look, feel, responsiveness and interactability.
UX refers to the overall experience felt by the customers from entering the restaurant till leaving the place.
